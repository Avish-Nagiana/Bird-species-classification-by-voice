# Topic: Bird Species Identification and Classification based on sound of bird 

### Introduction:  
Birdsong recognition is a crucial task in biodiversity studies, helping scientists and 
researchers monitor bird populations, study their behaviors, and ensure conservation 
efforts. Recognizing bird species based on their vocalizations poses unique challenges 
due to the variations in sound patterns, overlapping frequencies, and background 
noise in natural environments. In this project, we will explore various methods to 
identify and classify bird species based on their songs using machine learning 
techniques, specifically focusing on improving accuracy through data augmentation 
and model optimization. 
### Problem Definition:  
Bird species play an essential role in ecosystems, acting as indicators of 
environmental health. Without a proper system of monitoring, it becomes 
challenging to detect shifts in species populations â€“ whether due to environmental 
challenges, disease outbreaks or human development. Bird populations can fluctuate 
over short periods naturally, which makes it pretty difficult to detect long-term 
trends (Ludlow, 2017). The data recorded over span of multiple years helps 
researchers distinguish between short-term population changes and significant long
term declines (Ludlow, 2017). The main challenge over here is in the labor-intensive 
and time-consuming nature of traditional bird monitoring techniques, which often 
rely on human experts for species identification based on physical sightings or audio 
recordings (Ludlow, 2017). 
In this project, we aim to address the challenges of bird monitoring by automating 
the process of bird species identification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
model trained on bird audio recordings. The solution seeks to assist researchers and 
bird conservationists in identifying species with greater accuracy, speed and 
efficiency across various geographic locations. In the long term, the objective is to 
make species monitoring more scalable and help researchers detect environmental 
changes earlier by providing a streamlined method for processing large volumes of 
bird recordings. 
Speaking of the challenge, since we have never worked on audio datasets as machine learning projects, it could take time for us to figure out how to process and analyze 
such datasets. Besides, we might need to make extra effort to reduce background 
noise in the audio data. So that we will have better results for data analysis. 
Furthermore, unlike human language, different sounds of birds might sound like 
human and to model, which will increase the difficulty for identification and 
classification.

### Objectives: 
1. Develop a Bird Audio Identification System: Train a CNN model capable of 
identifying bird species from their vocalizations by using publicly available 
audio datasets. This will automate the process of recognizing and classifying 
bird species from audio recordings, saving not just time but also resources for 
conservation efforts. 
2. Analyze Long-Term Population Trends: The system will not only help in 
individual bird identification but also help with tracking and analyzing 
population trends over time. By automating this identification process, large 
datasets collected over several years can be processed, providing valuable 
insights into population changes, migration patterns and potential 
environmental threats. 
3. Enable Early Detection of Population Declines: By monitoring bird species 
over time, the system will help identify declines in population numbers before 
they become critical. The model can be integrated into larger bird 
conservation initiatives, enabling earlier intervention strategies in response to 
population dips caused by factors like habitat loss, climate change, or disease 
outbreaks. 
4. Contribute to Global Conservation Efforts: Create a scalable model that can 
be deployed globally to assist in monitoring bird species across diverse 
habitats. By improving the speed and accuracy of bird species identification, 
researchers will be able to manage and interpret large datasets, contributing 
to a more comprehensive understanding of global biodiversity trends. 
5. Facilitate Environmental Impact Assessments: Provide a tool that can support environmental monitoring, such as evaluating the impact of human 
development projects, deforestation, or agricultural expansion. Automated 
bird species identification will enhance the ability to assess how these factors 
influence bird populations and broader ecosystems.
